<h1>Why our lollipops?
<p> <h2>Our lollipops make a difference. Every time someone sneezes, a child needs a brown-pop. Lollipops are a way of life, they can change your day for the better, change a friend's day, and if you buy a donkey-pop, it can change your breath. While other brands, such as StupidStupids are very popular, they cannot compare to our Lollipops 4 Life.

<p>DISCLAIMER!!!
<p>The totally great and capable workers at Lollipops 4 Life have sadly eaten all of our lollipops. More coming never!
<p>Sorry for the inconveience!
<p> Please consider buying from our biggest competitor!
